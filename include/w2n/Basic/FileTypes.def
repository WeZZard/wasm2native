// TYPE(NAME, ID, SUFFIX, FLAGS)

// The first value is the type name as a string; this should be something which
// could be displayed to the user, or something which the user could provide.

// The second value is the type id, which will result in a
// w2n::file_types::TY_XX enum constant.

// The third value is the extension to use when creating temporary files
// of this type. It is also used when inferring a type from an extension.
// If multiple types specify the same extension, the first one is chosen when
// performing type inference.

// The fourth value is a string containing option flags. For now, this is
// unused, and should always be the empty string.
